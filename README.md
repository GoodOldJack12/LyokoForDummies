Examples of how to write an application with LyokoAPI

This Solution contains 4 Projects:
  + Extending
  + Reconstructing
  + Implementing (coming...someday)
  + Console App

You'll likely want to use Reconstructing. It's the simplest and doesn't force any structure on you.<br>
Extending is for if you want to use the same structure as LAPI does, and some useful pre-written methods.<br>

Do check out the console app to see how your main class should work with Plugins.
